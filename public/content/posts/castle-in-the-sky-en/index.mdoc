***Castle in the Sky***&nbsp;([Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language):&nbsp;天空の城ラピュタ,&nbsp;[Hepburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization):&nbsp;*Tenkū no Shiro Rapyuta*), also known as&nbsp;***Laputa: Castle in the Sky***, is a 1986 Japanese&nbsp;[animated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)&nbsp;[fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_film)&nbsp;[adventure film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film)&nbsp;written and directed by&nbsp;[Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki). It was produced by&nbsp;[Isao Takahata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isao_Takahata), animated by&nbsp;[Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli), and distributed by the&nbsp;[Toei Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toei_Company). In voice acting roles, the original Japanese version stars&nbsp;[Mayumi Tanaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayumi_Tanaka),&nbsp;[Keiko Yokozawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiko_Yokozawa), Kotoe Hatsui, and&nbsp;[Minori Terada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minori_Terada). The film follows orphans Sheeta and Pazu, who are chased by government agent Muska, the army, and a group of pirates over Sheeta's crystal necklace on their way to Laputa, a mythical castle flying in the sky.

*Castle in the Sky*&nbsp;is the first film to be animated by Studio Ghibli, with a production team comprising many of Miyazaki's longtime collaborators, who would continue to work with the studio for the following three decades. The studio's intent was to create original feature films without any compromise of quality. The film was partly inspired by Miyazaki's trips to Wales, where he witnessed the aftermath of the&nbsp;[1984 coal miners' strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_\(1984%E2%80%9385\)). The island of Laputa is used to highlight the theme of environmentalism, exploring the relationships between humanity, nature, and technology, a reflection of Miyazaki's ecological philosophy. The young protagonists also provide a unique perspective on the narrative, as a result of Miyazaki's desire to portray "the honesty and goodness of children in [his] work."[

The film released in Japanese theaters on August 2, 1986. It performed below expectations at the box office, but later achieved commercial success through rereleases, earning over&nbsp;US$157 million&nbsp;as of 2021. An English dub commissioned by&nbsp;[Tokuma Shoten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokuma_Shoten)&nbsp;in 1988 was distributed in North America by&nbsp;[Streamline Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline_Pictures), and another dub was produced by&nbsp;[Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures)&nbsp;in 1998, released internationally by&nbsp;[Buena Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_Home_Entertainment)&nbsp;in 2003. The film's score was composed by&nbsp;[Joe Hisaishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hisaishi), who would become a close collaborator of Miyazaki's; Hisaishi also composed a reworked soundtrack for the 2003 English dub. The film was generally acclaimed by critics, though the 2003 English dub received mixed reviews. It was well-received by audiences, being voted as one of the greatest animated films of all time in later years. The film also received several notable accolades.&nbsp;*Castle in the Sky*&nbsp;has since earned "[cult status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film)",[

## **Plot summary**

An airship carrying Sheeta – an orphan girl abducted by government agent Muska – is attacked by Dola and her gang, seeking Sheeta's crystal necklace. Attempting to escape, Sheeta falls from the airship, but is saved by the magic of the now-glowing crystal, which lowers her slowly. She is caught by Pazu, who takes her to his home. The next morning, Pazu shows Sheeta a picture his father took of Laputa, a mythical flying island. Determined to clear his father's name, Pazu vows to find Laputa. However, they are found and pursued by Dola's gang as well as the army and Muska. They are attacked and fall into a mine shaft, but are saved again by the crystal, which lowers them deep into the pit. In the tunnels, they meet Uncle Pom, who shows them deposits of the glowing mineral Aetherium, the same material as Sheeta's crystal.
